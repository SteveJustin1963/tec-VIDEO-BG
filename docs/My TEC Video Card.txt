My TEC Video Card:

A work in progress. 
	The latest FPGA configuration file is HERE

The address and port 
	breakdown is as follows:

Base Address of Expansion socket = 0x1000
Mode Register = Port3
Scroll Register = Port4

When in Mode0: - Video RAM Access
Scroll Register = xPssssss
x=dont care
P=Page
s=Scroll Offset
32x32 Character visible screen area located at 0x1000-0x13FF
32x32 Character off screen area located at 0x1400-17FF
1 Page = 32x64 Characters.

When in Mode1: - Character RAM Access
2kbytes Character RAM are mapped to 0x1000-0x17FF
Charaters are drawn as:
0bxxxxxxxx ;Byte 0
0bxxxxxxxx ;Byte 1
0bxxxxxxxx ;Byte 2
0bxxxxxxxx ;Byte 3
0bxxxxxxxx ;Byte 4
0bxxxxxxxx ;Byte 5
0bxxxxxxxx ;Byte 6
0bxxxxxxxx ;Byte 7

When in Mode2: - Spirte Attribute Access
5 Sprites available
0x1000 - Sprite1 X location
0x1001 - Sprite1 Y location
0x1002 - Sprite2 X location
0x1003 - Sprite2 Y location
Down to.....
0x1010 - Sprite9 X location
0x1011 - Sprite9 Y location
0x1012 - Sprite10 X location
0x1013 - Sprite10 Y location

0x1014 - Sprite1 Tile Pointer
0x1015 - Sprite2 Tile Pointer
Down to.....
0x101D - Sprite10 Tile Pointer

When in Mode3: - Sprite RAM Access
0x1000 - 0x1007 Sprite1 Character Data (Tiles)
Down to.....
0x13F0 - 0x13FF Sprite 128 Character Data

Each sprite can use any one of 128 sprite tiles. 
	This is handy for turning them off (selecting a blank tile) 
	or animation (changing the tile without re-writing new tile data) 
	as well as multiplexing tiles to draw more than 10 sprites on screen at once.

Sprites not valid in location 0,0

When power is first applied, 
	ChrRAM is pre-loaded with the default DOS ASCII character set 
	and Vram loaded with a messages on page 0.
